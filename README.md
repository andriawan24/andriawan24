I'm a Mobile Engineer and Tech Enthusiast. I love to code and learn about the latest tech and anything about programming, I also like to read a book, travel, and have a cup of coffee in my favorite coffee shop ☕️. Every weekday I spent building my company, and every weekend I spent building myself.

**Talking about Personal Stuff:**

- 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently working as a Mobile Engineer, focusing on Android Native Development (and a little bit of iOS);
- 🚀 I’m currently learning how to design (at least for my personal project);
- 💬 Ask me about anything, especially computer science or programming stuff, I am happy to help;
